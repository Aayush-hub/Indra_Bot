# ABSTRACT :
My project is mainly focusing on health-related problems. Chatbots in healthcare would be useful during this COVID-19 pandemic, the most domain NLP Platform which I've used was Dialog flow and Front end for integration. AI-powered chatbots can be used to trigger patients and guide them to receive the appropriate help. Chatbots are considered a more reliable and accurate alternative to online searches patients carry out when they’re trying to understand the cause of their symptoms. It can understand user queries.
