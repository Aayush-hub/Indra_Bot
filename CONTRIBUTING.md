# Contributing Guidelines

First of all, congrats and thanks for contributing to this project! ü•≥ We know that you want to contribute as much as possible to any open-sourced project!
And that's why we wanted to share a few tips and guidlines to you!

## How to contribute?

This is the question which all beginners ask. Well, try to browse the repo, look for any bug/error in the project; it may be UI, Code-based, backend, docs.
Whatever it is, a bug is a bug. If you found so, try to report using the "Issues". If not, it's okay, you can even say some features you want to have in our project!

## Steps for PR creation

This is a most important one so beware! Failing to perform any of these rules will result in closing your PR, irrespective of changes made

 1. Fork the repo first
 2. Then create a separate branch out of `main` and not in `main` (To do this in Git, type `git checkout -b <any-branch-name>`)
 3. Find the issue to work on and ping us so that we could assign you! (You can find an issue and ask or create one and ask, avoid duplicates!)
 4. Make your changes and commit them (Try to give a concise and good commit message)
 5. Make a PR in GitHub and tell us what issue will fix this. Answer the questions given in the template
 6. Wait for us to review, if accepted ü•≥ If not, try to make the change we suggested

<!-- More rules to come after setting up CI tests -->

And that's it! ü•á you contributed! Oh if you liked this repo, make sure to star it ‚≠ê and happy contributing! ;)
